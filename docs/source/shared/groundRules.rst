Be proactive
++++++++++++

In my experience, the single most common cause of poor performance in any course is when students are not proactive. When you are proactive you can recognize and address any issues with your courses, while you have time to do something about it. Learning to be proactive is one of the most valuable skills you can acquire in college. 

Here's how you can be proactive, so you can succeed in this coure.

* Review homework (or other take-home tests) within 24 hours of assignment. Identify questions that may be challenging. Contact the instructor or seek tutoring to work on these questions. `The Department of Computer Science offers tutoring services almost on a daily basis. <https://www.luc.edu/cs/academics/tutoring/>`_

* Significantly incomplete assignments and skipped assigments arena warning sign. Compare your solution to the published solution. Try to identify the differences. Speak with the instructor or a tutor if the differences are not clear.

* Come to class and take notes. Form or join a study group comprising fellow students.

* If, for any reason, you need to be absent from class, let me know in advance. I don't need to know the reason, but I need to know about the duration of your absense.

* Check your official Loyola email at least daily and absolutely an hour before class meetings.

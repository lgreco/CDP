Instructor's expectations
--------------------------------------------------------


* Read your **email** regularly (like, twice a day). 

* **Read** everything carefully! Assignments, announcements, class notes, and program contents contain 99% of the information you need.

* Make an **effort.** If you cannot finish the code, show some pseudocode.

* **Ask for help.** Spend between 20 and 40 minutes on an assignment. If you feel you are not making progress, ask for help.

* The internet is full of sites with “solutions” to problems. Be careful when using them. Most of the stuff posted there is **junk.** If you use code from these sites, you must **demonstrate** that you understand it fully.

* Use the Programmer’s Pact as a checklist before you submit code for evaluation. (COMP 170, 271 only).

* No communications starting with the greeting **“hey”.**
 

* For code troubleshooting **attach the program file** to an email or message. Please, no screenshots or links to cloud storage services. (If you are using a hosted IDE like Collaboratory or repl.it, send me a link to the code but make sure the file is shared).

* **Be on time.** Commuting around Chicago is always full of surprises. Delays may be inevitable. Nevertheless, punctuality is a formidable professional skill. Learn it, practice it!

* If you make an **appointment** for Student Hours but cannot keep it, notify me as soon as possible.

* When on Zoom, your **camera must be on.** (If your computer has no camera, if camera is broken etc, please let me know).

* If I ask you a question in a message, please **answer it.**

* Waiting for the **last day** to work on an assignment is risky. Ideally, you want to look at an assignment within the first 24 hours it is posted. Formulate a strategy. See if you have any questions to ask. Put some pseudocode to share with me.

* Instead of asking if some idea could work, **try it!** The best way to tell if something works is to code it and find out for yourself. If it doesn’t work, you have a conversation starter when you reach out to me for assistance.

* **Come to class.**

* If you are taking an **asynchronous** course with me, please schedule at least 4 meetings with me during the term. These meetings must be spaced out throughout the semester. Plan your first meeting with me during week 3. It is a good idea to plan one meeting for the week after the midterm, to discuss progress. I also expect you to be in touch with me on a weekly basis, via email or messaging, with questions about your assignments, study, etc.

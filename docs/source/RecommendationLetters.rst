Recommendation Letters
======================

Writing recommendation letters is part of my job and a privilege. I am happy to write a recommendation for students who worked with me and did well.

In many cases you have a right to read the recommendation letter -- for example, most graduate schoool application processes allow you to opt for that. You can also waive your right to read the recommendation letter.

My suggestion to you is that you waive that right when asking for a letter from me. I will write the letter for you in either case, but the content will be different. Letters that can be read by their beneficiary are more boiler plate. That's to protect both you and myself from misunderstandings. If you waive your right to read the letter, I can be more candid in the letter and provide a more helpful assessment of your abilities.

In either case, if I agree to write a letter for you, it means that I think highly of you and I want to help. Waiving your right to the letter allows me to write a strong letter in the shortest period of time, without worrying how you may interpret something I wrote. To do the same with a letter that you can read, requires much more time than I have. And so, I write a simpler letter, that takes about the same time as a candid letter than you will not read.

When asking me for a letter, it is always helpful to share with me a copy of your resume, or a list of other courses that you took, and maybe 3-4 key items that you would like me to emphasize on my letter for you.

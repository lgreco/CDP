This course explores the concepts of data abstraction and data structure, including stacks, queues, lists, sets, and trees. The issues of implementing a data structure in a language such as Java are examined using classes, arrays, and linked structures. Sorting and searching techniques are analyzed. The concepts of correctness and efficiency of algorithms are developed. Time/space comparisons of iterative algorithms with recursive algorithms are made. 

The tentative outline for the course is as follows.

 - Introduction to Java
 - Object-Oriented Concepts
 - Additional Features of Programming and Java
 - Analysis of Algorithms
 - Java Collections Framework
 - Recursion
 - Array-Based Lists
 -  Linked Lists
 - Stacks and Queues
 - Binary Trees
 - Binary Search Trees
 - Sorting
 - Tree Maps and Tree Sets
 - Priority Queues
 - Hashing
 - Graphs, Trees, and Networks
 
Time permitting the course will cover unusual data strutures like blockchain and relational models.

Textbook
++++++++

*Building Java Programs: A Back to Basics Approach,* 5th Edition, by Stuart Reges and Marty Stepp. (Yes, this is the textbook used in COMP 170)

Computer Equipment
++++++++++++++++++
You will need access to a desktop or laptop computer with a simple text editor and a Java compiler. An Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) is a superb tool and   and `IntelliJ IDEA <https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/>`_, is the IDE of choice for this course. You may also request a virtual machine that comes with all the necessary tools and that you may access from any web browser, anywhere in the world.

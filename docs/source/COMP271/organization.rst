This course explores the concepts of data abstraction and data structure, including stacks, queues, lists, sets, and trees. The issues of implementing a data structure in a language such as Java are examined using classes, arrays, and linked structures. Sorting and searching techniques are analyzed. The concepts of correctness and efficiency of algorithms are developed. Time/space comparisons of iterative algorithms with recursive algorithms are made. 

The tentative contents for the course is as follows.

 - Introduction to Java
 - Object-Oriented Concepts
 - Additional Features of Programming and Java
 - Analysis of Algorithms
 - Java Collections Framework
 - Recursion
 - Array-Based Lists
 -  Linked Lists
 - Stacks and Queues
 - Binary Trees
 - Binary Search Trees
 - Sorting
 - Tree Maps and Tree Sets
 - Priority Queues
 - Hashing
 - Graphs, Trees, and Networks
 
Time permitting the course will cover unusual data strutures like blockchain and relational models. These contents are organized as follows:

- Week 1: **Introduction to Java and Data Structures**
  - Introduction to Java, IDEs, and setup

  - Implementing singly linked lists in Java
  - Introduction to object-oriented concepts: classes and objects

- Week 4: **Linked Lists - Part 2**
  - Enhancing linked list with OOP: constructors and encapsulation
  - Doubly linked lists and circular lists
  - Practical applications of linked lists

- Week 5: **Stacks**

  - Custom data structures with OOP principles
  - Interface-driven implementations

- Week 10: **Complexity Analysis**
  - Introduction to time and space complexity
  - Analyzing the efficiency of different data structures
  - Case studies in optimizing data structures

- Week 11: **Integrative Projects**
  - Students design and implement a project that uses multiple data structures
  - Projects focus on real-world applications using OOP principles
  - Preparing for project presentations

- Week 12: **Project Presentations and Course Wrap-up**

Textbook
++++++++

*Building Java Programs: A Back to Basics Approach,* 5th Edition, by Stuart Reges and Marty Stepp. (Yes, this is the textbook used in COMP 170)

Computer Equipment
++++++++++++++++++
You will need access to a desktop or laptop computer with a simple text editor and a Java compiler. An Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) is a superb tool and   and `IntelliJ IDEA <https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/>`_, is the IDE of choice for this course. You may also request a virtual machine that comes with all the necessary tools and that you may access from any web browser, anywhere in the world.

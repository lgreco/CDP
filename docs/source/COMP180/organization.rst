COMP 180 serves two purposes: one is to introduce you to simple programming, using *Python*. The other is to show you how you can process and manage data (using Python, of course). Data processing and data management require some mathema**g**ical skills. Any college-level course in algebra or calculus is sufficient background. The course has three parts: 

* Introduction to programming with Python, using interactive Python notebooks. If you have taken an introductory programming course before, this part may appear redundant. However, it will be worth your time as we'll explore the comforts and and features of interactive Python notebooks, and discuss some practical topics in programming. Expect 3-4 weeks.

* Managing and processing numerical (mostly) data. Computing was (and is) about manipulating numbers. Where do these numbers come from? How we obtain them? How we represent them? How we turn them into information, insight, and knowledge? Expect 6-7 weeks.

* Working with text data. There is so much content published on the web. Can we plow through it? Can we find reliable information? Can we tell fake news from facts? These questions can be answered with text analysis that is often considered a gateway to artificial intelligence and machine learning. Expect 4-5 weeks.



Textbook
++++++++
There is no required textbook for this course. Reading material will be posted online as needed.

Computer Equipment
++++++++++++++++++
You will also need access to a computer (laptop or desktop) with a web browser. No other software is required for the course. We will use a web-based programming environment hosted by Google. To access this environment, called Google Colaboratory, you'll need a Google account. If you do not have one already, you can sign up for one (it's free).

Grading scheme
++++++++++++++

Course performance is determined using weekly homework, a take-home midterm, and a take-home final. Each assessment component carries a 33.33% weight. Grading scheme aside, the objective of assessments in this course is to ensure **that students are learning.** In this context students make mistakes, understand them, and do not repeat them.

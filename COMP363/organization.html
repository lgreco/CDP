<h1>Course operations and COVID19<a class="headerlink" href="#course-operations-and-covid19" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h1>
<p>In the <strong>Spring 2022,</strong> I teach <strong>COMP 170</strong> (Introduction to Object Oriented Programming), <strong>COMP 180</strong> (Computing and Data), and together with William Honig, <strong>COMP 397</strong> (Research Methods in CS). All my courses are setup for <strong>Hybrid</strong> delivery: you can come to class or you can join the meeting via Zoom. With one exception, all class meetings are <strong>synchronous</strong>.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>However, ALL CLASS MEETINGS THROUGH JANUALY 31, 2022 WILL BE ONLINE ONLY in compliance with the University’s COVID mitigation practices.</p></li>
<li><p>Per university policy, everyone is required to wear a face mask in all public spaces and in all buildings at all Loyola campuses. There are no exceptions or exemptions. This includes in classrooms, labs, meeting rooms, lounges, shared office space, cubicles, hallways, and elevators. Faculty must wear masks while teaching. All students must wear a face mask properly, and that means covering the nose, mouth, and chin. Infractions will be reported online through the Office of Student Conduct and Conflict Resolution.</p></li>
<li><p>Students removing their mask to take a drink is acceptable, but removing the mask to eat is not. Students who need to have food available during class should work with the Student Accessibility Center to have that accommodation documented.</p></li>
<li><p>The principal method for online meetings is Zoom. You must <a class="reference external" href="https://zoom.us/download">have it installed on your computer, tablet, or smartphone</a>. A link to our Zoom “classroom” is available on the course’s Sakai site. There will be no separate emails with the Zoom link.</p></li>
<li><p>If, at any time, Zoom is unavailable due to high-demand or any other reason, our fall-back method for online meetings will be Google Hangouts. You will need to <a class="reference external" href="https://accounts.google.com/signup/">sign up for a free Google account</a>, if you do not already have one. (If you have a gmail address, you have a Google account). In case we need to switch to Google Hangouts for a class meeting, you will be notified by email sent to your official LUC.EDU address.</p></li>
<li><p>If we experience a Zoom disruption during the first half of class meeting, we will switch to Google Hangouts immediately. If the disruption occurs during the second half of the class meeting, we’ll cancel the rest of the meeting, and I will provide notes and reading suggestions to make up for the lost time. If there is a disruption to a Zoom meeting, please check your Loyola email within 5 minutes. As soon as I troubleshoot the disruption and determine the best course of action, I will email you with instructions about how and where to reconvene.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Student hours</strong> (aka, office hours) are <strong>by appointment and via Zoom only</strong>. <a class="reference external" href="https://calendly.com/leo_irakliotis/20min">Please use the Calendly website to schedule an appointment</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>It is my commitment to make my courses as classes as engaging and productive as possible. To achieve that, I will need your help. Please reach out to me at any time with suggestions, concerns, and ideas related to the course and to your studies. If you prefer to share your thoughts in a confidential way, you can <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfbbQkdO0buLZp17udHjphZYgZwkcZBgp3Tx6k0f6iMV_TykQ/viewform?usp=sf_link">use an anonymous feedback form</a>.

<h1>Recordings<a class="headerlink" href="#recordings" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h1>
<p><em>This applies to online and hybrid sections only</em>.</p>
<p>Zoom sessions are recorded and available to watch later if, for some serious reason you may not be able to attend a class meeting. Notice that the availability of recordings is not a reason to skip class. Zoom provides me with attendance information and I will be monitoring it closely. Some courses include in-class assessments as part of the grading scheme. I am planning to continue conducting these assessments even when meeting remotely, so your attendance is critical.</p>
<p>Recordings are made available only to Loyola Students. You must contact me and provide a justification as to why you missed class if you wish access to a recorded meeting. Authentication (using your LUC login credentials) is required to access a recording. These recordings will be removed after the semester is over. Downloading of these recordings is not possible.</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Asymptotic notation, space and time complexity: why it matters?</p></li>
<li><p>The source of all evil and good: recursion and its master theorem.</p></li>
<li><p>Dynamic programming (i.e., recursion done right).</p></li>

<li><p>Graph algorithms (bomb your enemies’ train tracks!)</p></li>
<li><p>Stuff that can win you the <em>Turing Award:</em> NP-hardness</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The central goal of this course is to impart basic skills in designing and implementing efficient and effective computer programs. The course begins by developing models and mathematical tools for measuring the efficiency of algorithms, followed by a variety of useful data structures and to algorithms for a variety of fundamental problems. Finally, the course will provide an introduction to classification of computational problems into different complexity classes. Actual programming will be interspersed with theoretical analysis, to demonstrate practical issues in the implementation of algorithmic solutions.</p>
<p>Designing <em>good</em> algorithms is central to software design. So, what makes an algorithm good? This goes beyond just arriving at the right answer, to arriving at this right answer efficiently. After all, you don’t want to be staring at your computer all day just to get the sum of a dozen numbers. Efficiency is not just with respect to time, but also the resources required to solve the problem. Central to our discussion of algorithms will be the evaluation of solutions. Algorithms at its heart is problem solving.</p>
<p>In this course we will focus on tapping into our creativity to identify possible solutions to a given problem. The course will blend application and theory. We will use a programming language (to be determined) to practice design and implementation of algorithms.</p>
<p>You must have access to a computer (Mac, Windows, or
Ubuntu operating system) that s/he has administrative rights, i.e. can install software. Computers must
have a minimum of 4 GB of RAM and a reliable internet connection.</p>

<h2>Be proactive<a class="headerlink" href="#be-proactive" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>In my experience, the single most common cause of poor performance in any course is when students are not proactive. When you are proactive you can recognize and address any issues with your courses. And learning to be proactive is one of the most valuable skills you can acquire in college.</p>
<p>Here’s how you can be proactive, so you can succeed in this coure.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Review homework (or other take-home tests) within 24 hours of assignment. Identify questions that may be challenging. Contact the instructor or seek tutoring to work on these questions. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.luc.edu/cs/academics/tutoring/">The Department of Computer Science offers tutoring services almost on a daily basis.</a></p></li>
<li><p>A grade of less than 50% in any assignment, is a warning sign. Compare your solution to the published solution. Try to identify the differences. Speak with the instructor or a tutor if the differences are not clear.</p></li>
<li><p>Come to class and take notes. Form or join a study group comprising fellow students.</p></li>
<li><p>If, for any reason, you need to be absent from class, let me know in advance. I don’t need to know the reason, but I need to know about the duration of your absense.</p></li>
<li><p>Check your official Loyola email at least daily and absolutely an hour before class meetings.</p></li>

<p>The required textbook for COMP 363 is <em>Algorithms,</em> by Jeff Erickson. <a class="reference external" href="https://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/">The book is available online at no cost</a>. Printed copies can be purchased from online retailers for about $30.</p>
</section>
<section id="grading-scheme">
<h2>Grading scheme<a class="headerlink" href="#grading-scheme" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>Course performance is determined using weekly assignments, a take-home midterm, and a take-home final. Each assessment component carries a 33.3% weight. Grading scheme aside, the objective of assessments in this course is to ensure <strong>that students are learning.</strong> In this context students make mistakes, understand them, and do not repeat them.</p>
</section>
<section id="grading-scale">
<h2>Grading scale<a class="headerlink" href="#grading-scale" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>In general, if your total score in the class is &gt; 90% you should expect an A. For a B, your score should be between 80% and 90%. If your score is between 65% and 70%, you should expect a C. These ranges may change during the course. I do not provide a breakdown for <strong>plus</strong> and <strong>minus</strong> grade points.</p>

<section id="academic-integrity">
<h1>Academic integrity<a class="headerlink" href="#academic-integrity" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h1>
<p>Students are expected and encouraged to work together. It is also expected that students will explore the vastness of the internet to discover information, knowledge, and solutions to problems. I consider all that to be part of your learning experience. It is up to you, however, to demonstrate your learning.</p>
<p>In practical terms this means that you should be able to describe in your own words how a piece of code works or how you arrived to a mathematical derivation, etc. Failure to do so will affect your course performance and, ultimately, your grade. It may also raise concerns related to academic integrity. <em>Verbatim</em> use of material obtained from others is considered a violation of the university’s policies for academic integrity.</p>
<p>Please note that if you can search for an answer on the internet, so can your instructor. When it comes to programming, there are several websites with good code examples. These are <a class="reference external" href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/">geeksforgeeks</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://stackoverflow.com/">stackoverflow</a>, etc. You are expected to explore these sites. The code you find there can be extremely useful. <strong>It is up to you to turn these websites into a learning experience.</strong> How? By internalizing the code that you discover in these sites and adopt for your assignments.</p>
<p>Computing, i.e., programming and its foundational topics such as mathematics, is something that is best learned by example. But copying other people’s work alone is not sufficient. We must internalize that work, i.e., we must understand how someone else’s code works, how it does it, and why. Without that internalization, we simply copy someone else’s work. And that is not sufficient to pass a course.</p>

<section id="be-cool-like-a-pro">
<h1>Be cool, like a <em>pro</em><a class="headerlink" href="#be-cool-like-a-pro" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h1>
<p>In additional to the technical content of the course, there is a professional element to it. The professional element of the course is meant to cultivate your <strong>essential work skills</strong> (some call them “soft skills”). These skills are highly sought after by employers. Essential skills include communication skills, neatness, punctuality, dependability, ability to work in teams, problem solving skills, etc.</p>
<p>In the context of this course, professionalism and essential skills are as follows.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Be clear in your communications. When sending an email, make sure that it has an opening, an objective, and a closing.</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>The opening is a greeting line. “Hey” is never an appropriate opening in professional communications.</p></li>
<li><p>The objective is the main part of your email. Be precise and concise. For example, instead of writing “may I ask a question”, just ask the question.</p></li>
<li><p>The closing is a statement as to what you would like the other party to do in response to your message.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Be respectful of others’ time. Here’re two examples:</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Come to meetings (class, student (aka office) hours, study groups, tutoring, etc) <strong>prepared.</strong> If the meeting is about reviewing your code, make sure that your laptop is sufficiently charged, the computer is turned on, and the code is already loaded into some editor before you even step into the meeting room. Do not spend 5 minutes in the meeting finding a power outlet, turning on and booting the computer, and firing up an editor.</p></li>
<li><p>Online class meetings are <strong>not</strong> the place to text the instructor questions related to individual concerns (your grade in a homework assignment etc.) Please do not use class time for such questions.</p></li>
<li><p>When in group meeting (e.g., class, study group, etc) keep your questions relevant to the objective of the meeting.</p></li>
<li><p>When making an appointment and you realize that you cannot attend the meeting, notify the other party as soon as possible.</p></li>
<li><p>When discussing a problem, be prepared to offer suggestions for reasonable solutions.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Be respectful of <strong>your own time.</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Try emailing a question instead of waiting for Student (office) Hours. If the question is related to programming, attach a copy of your code. In most cases you will get an answer within a few hours.</p></li>
<li><p>Read and understand instructions and requirements. They set the expectations for your work. It’s important that you follow them.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Be organized and neat.</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>When turning in homework or other assignments, make sure that your writing is legible and the overall appearance reflects quality and care. Content is always the most critical aspect of your work; but appearance counts too.</p></li>
<li><p>When submitting code, make sure the files are properly named. For example <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">homework.java</span></code> may make sense on your side of the shop, but from the grader’s perspective it’s not very helpful. Files should be named after the class they contain, and must include comments in the code identifying you as the author.</p></li>
<li><p>When submitting photos of your work, name the files accordingly. Instead of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">IMG_123.JPG</span></code> it should be called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">JohnDoe_problem1a.jpg</span></code> or something equally indicative of where the file is coming from and what it contains.</p></li>
<li><p>Follow instructions. Instructions and directions reflect expectations and requirements for your work. File naming conventions, deadlines, content style, etc, are important aspects of your work both in college and beyond.</p></li>
<li><p>Check your official Loyola email regularly (at least once a day, and definitely an hour before class).</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>

<li><p>Every effort is made in this course to use open source, freely available material. However materials from the course cannot be shared outside the course without the instructor’s <em>written permission.</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Accommodation letters.</strong> Students with accommodation letters from the university’s SAC need to alert me as early as possible in the course. In some of my courses, I conduct weekly in-class assessment instead of homework assignments. Students work on these assessments, during class, for 15-25 minutes. If your accommodation letter entitles you to extended time for testing, I will be happy to make arrangements so that you can return the in-class assessment to me within 24 hours. Please notify me as soon as possible, if you would like extended time fo in-class assessments.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Duty to report.</strong> Faculty and staff of the University have a mandated responsibility to report any incidents of gender-based misconduct that they are made aware of, even if it happened in the past. Gender-based misconduct includes discrimination based on actual or perceived sex, sexual orientation, gender expression or identity, or pregnancy or parenting status; dating and domestic violence; sexual misconduct (including sexual assault, sexual harassment, and sexual exploitation); and stalking.</p></li>
<li><p>Statement about <strong>online recording.</strong> In this class, software will be used to record live class discussions. As a student in this class, your participation in live class discussions will be recorded. These recordings will be made available only to students enrolled in the class, to assist those who cannot attend the live session or to serve as a resource for those who would like to review content that was presented. All recordings will become unavailable to students in the class when the Sakai course is unpublished (i.e. shortly after the course ends, per the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.luc.edu/its/itrs/sakai/administrativeschedule/">Sakai administrative schedule</a>). Students who prefer to participate via audio only will be allowed to disable their video camera so only audio will be captured. Please discuss this option with your instructor.The use of all video recordings will be in keeping with the University Privacy Statement shown below.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Privacy Statement.</strong> Assuring privacy among faculty and students engaged in online and face-to-face instructional activities helps promote open and robust conversations and mitigates concerns that comments made within the context of the class will be shared beyond the classroom. As such, recordings of instructional activities occurring in online or face-to-face classes may be used solely for internal class purposes by the faculty member and students registered for the course, and only during the period in which the course is offered. Students will be informed of such recordings by a statement in the syllabus for the course in which they will be recorded. Instructors who wish to make subsequent use of recordings that include student activity may do so only with informed written consent of the students involved or if all student activity is removed from the recording. Recordings including student activity that have been initiated by the instructor may be retained by the instructor only for individual use.</p></li>

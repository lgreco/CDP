<p>In the <strong>Spring 2023,</strong> I teach <strong>COMP 306/406</strong> (Data Mining), and <strong>COMP 363/460</strong> (Algorithms), and COMP 170 (Introductory Programming).</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Synchronous sessions will be available on Zoom. You must <a class="reference external" href="https://zoom.us/download">have it installed on your computer, tablet, or smartphone</a>. A link to our Zoom “classroom” is available on the course’s Sakai site. There will be no separate emails with the Zoom link. Zoom availability is provided for emergencies only. Students are expected to be in class. You may use Zoom if you are isolating for health reason, if you are traveling, if you are facing a family emergency, if commute to campus is horrendous due to traffic, or if weather conditions make it difficult to come to class.</p></li>
<li><p>If, at any time, Zoom is unavailable due to high-demand or any other reason, our fall-back method for online meetings will be Google Hangouts. You will need to <a class="reference external" href="https://accounts.google.com/signup/">sign up for a free Google account</a>, if you do not already have one. (If you have a gmail address, you have a Google account). In case we need to switch to Google Hangouts for a class meeting, you will be notified by email sent to your official LUC.EDU address.</p></li>
<li><p>If we experience a Zoom disruption during the first half of class meeting, we will switch to Google Hangouts immediately. If the disruption occurs during the second half of the class meeting, we’ll cancel the rest of the meeting, and I will provide notes and reading suggestions to make up for the lost time. If there is a disruption to a Zoom meeting, please check your Loyola email within 5 minutes. As soon as I troubleshoot the disruption and determine the best course of action, I will email you with instructions about how and where to reconvene.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Student hours</strong> (aka, office hours) are <strong>by appointment and via Zoom only</strong>. <a class="reference external" href="https://calendly.com/leo_irakliotis/20min">Please use the Calendly website to schedule an appointment</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>It is my commitment to make my courses as classes as engaging and productive as possible. To achieve that, I will need your help. Please reach out to me at any time with suggestions, concerns, and ideas related to the course and to your studies. If you prefer to share your thoughts in a confidential way, you can <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfbbQkdO0buLZp17udHjphZYgZwkcZBgp3Tx6k0f6iMV_TykQ/viewform?usp=sf_link">use an anonymous feedback form</a>.

<h1>Recordings<a class="headerlink" href="#recordings" title="Link to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>Zoom sessions are recorded and available to watch later if, for some serious reason you may not be able to attend a class meeting. <strong>Notice that the availability of recordings is not a reason to skip class without a justifiable reason.</strong> Zoom provides me with attendance information and I will be monitoring it closely. Some courses include in-class assessments as part of the grading scheme. I am planning to continue conducting these assessments even when meeting remotely, so your attendance is critical.</p>
<p>Recordings are made available only to Loyola Students. You must contact me and provide a justification as to why you missed class if you wish access to a recorded meeting. Authentication (using your LUC login credentials) is required to access a recording. These recordings will be removed after the semester is over. Downloading of these recordings is not possible.</p>

<p>In this course, we’ll look at the foundations of research in computing, the motivations, the style, and the results. Doing so will allow us (and we mean it, us) to understand better and deeper what drives innovation in the discipline. How to tell a truly emerging trend from a passing infatuation. How to communicate an idea or an opinion about one.</p>
<p>If you are taking this course to pursue a specific research topic or idea, please talk with your instructor sooner than later. Depending on your interests they may (or may not) be able to accommodate your plans.</p>
<p>The course requires you to do a fair amount of reading and writing.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Introductions. Foundations by Bush and von Neumann. A quick approach to critical reading of papers. Assignment: critical summaries of papers (200 words/paper/max) for non-technical audience, due in class. Require some formatting, maybe Google Docs.</p></li>
<li><p>In-class peer review of last week’s critical summaries. Discussion about writing style, comment and review style. Assignment. Cryptography: read the DH paper.</p></li>
<li><p>DH review. Introduction to paper taxonomies, repositories, library searches. Assignment: a non-technical review of cryptography applications since DH. What is the most foundation paper cited by DH?</p></li>
<li><p>In-class peer review of last week’s paper. Writing tools and styles. Bibliographies and literature searches. Assignment. read Codd’s original paper.</p></li>
<li><p>In-class discussion of Codd: can you draw parallels to OOP? What/which? What was the transformational concept? The foundation? Assignment: Peter Chen’s ERD paper and NAS’ report on Database industry</p></li>
<li><p>In-class review of ERD concepts and the emergence of UML.  Assignment: commonalities of seminal papers: write a 200w critical review of any commonalities you see across DH and Codd.</p></li>
<li><p>The Dijkstra archive at the U of Texas. Why are these papers important. A review of his work. Assignment: tbd critical summary one of Dijkstra’s papers.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>#In-class peer review of last week’s summary. Assignment: Cerf/Khan, and a non-technical summary of packet switching and best-effort protocols.</p>
<p># .In-class peer review of last week’s summary. Assignments: Metropolis and a 200w review</p>

<section id="be-proactive">
<h2>Be proactive<a class="headerlink" href="#be-proactive" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>In my experience, the single most common cause of poor performance in any course is when students are not proactive. When you are proactive you can recognize and address any issues with your courses, while you have time to do something about it. Learning to be proactive is one of the most valuable skills you can acquire in college.</p>
<p>Here’s how you can be proactive, so you can succeed in this coure.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Review homework (or other take-home tests) within 24 hours of assignment. Identify questions that may be challenging. Contact the instructor or seek tutoring to work on these questions. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.luc.edu/cs/academics/tutoring/">The Department of Computer Science offers tutoring services almost on a daily basis.</a></p></li>
<li><p>Significantly incomplete assignments and skipped assigments arena warning sign. Compare your solution to the published solution. Try to identify the differences. Speak with the instructor or a tutor if the differences are not clear.</p></li>
<li><p>Come to class and take notes. Form or join a study group comprising fellow students.</p></li>
<li><p>If, for any reason, you need to be absent from class, let me know in advance. I don’t need to know the reason, but I need to know about the duration of your absense.</p></li>
<li><p>Check your official Loyola email at least daily and absolutely an hour before class meetings.</p></li>

<section id="instructor-s-expectations">
<h1>Instructor’s expectations<a class="headerlink" href="#instructor-s-expectations" title="Link to this heading"></a></h1>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Read your <strong>email</strong> regularly and <em>always</em> before heading out to class.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Read</strong> everything carefully! Assignments, announcements, class notes, and program contents contain 99% of the information you need.</p></li>
<li><p>Make an <strong>effort.</strong> If you cannot finish the code, show some pseudocode.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ask for help.</strong> Spend between 20 and 40 minutes on an assignment. If you feel you are not making progress, ask for help.</p></li>
<li><p>The internet is full of sites with “solutions” to problems. Be careful when using them. Most of the stuff posted there is <strong>junk.</strong> If you use code from these sites, you must <strong>demonstrate</strong> that you understand it fully.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the Programmer’s Pact as a checklist before you submit code for evaluation.</p></li>
<li><p>No communications starting with the greeting <strong>“hey”.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>For code troubleshooting <strong>attach the program file</strong> to an email or message. Please, no screenshots or links to cloud storage services. (If you are using a hosted IDE like Collaboratory or repl.it, send me a link to the code but make sure the file is shared).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Be on time.</strong> Commuting around Chicago is always full of surprises. Delays may be inevitable. Nevertheless, punctuality is a formidable professional skill. Learn it, practice it!</p></li>
<li><p>If you make an <strong>appointment</strong> for Student Hours but cannot keep it, notify me as soon as possible.</p></li>
<li><p>If I ask you a question in a email/message, please <strong>answer it.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Waiting for the <strong>last day</strong> to work on an assignment is risky. Ideally, you want to look at an assignment within the first 24 hours it is posted. Formulate a strategy. See if you have any questions to ask. Put some pseudocode to share with me.</p></li>
<li><p>Instead of asking if some idea could work, <strong>try it!</strong> The best way to tell if something works is to code it and find out for yourself. If it doesn’t work, you have a conversation starter when you reach out to me for assistance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Come to class.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>If you are taking an <strong>asynchronous</strong> course with me, please schedule at least 4 meetings with me during the term. These meetings must be spaced out throughout the semester. Plan your first meeting with me during week 3. It is a good idea to plan one meeting for the week after the midterm, to discuss progress. I also expect you to be in touch with me on a weekly basis, via email or messaging, with questions about your assignments, study, etc.</p></li>

<section id="academic-integrity">
<h1>Academic integrity<a class="headerlink" href="#academic-integrity" title="Link to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>Students are expected and encouraged to work together. It is also expected that students will explore the vastness of the internet to discover information, knowledge, and solutions to problems. I consider all that to be part of your learning experience. It is up to you, however, to demonstrate your learning.</p>
<p>In practical terms this means that you should be able to describe in your own words how a piece of code works or how you arrived to a mathematical derivation, etc. Failure to do so will affect your course performance and, ultimately, your grade. It may also raise concerns related to academic integrity. <em>Verbatim</em> use of material obtained from others is considered a violation of the university’s policies for academic integrity.</p>
<p>Please note that if you can search for an answer on the internet, so can your instructor. When it comes to programming, there are several websites with good code examples. These are <a class="reference external" href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/">geeksforgeeks</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://stackoverflow.com/">stackoverflow</a>, etc. You are expected to explore these sites. The code you find there can be extremely useful. <strong>It is up to you to turn these websites into a learning experience.</strong> How? By internalizing the code that you discover in these sites and adopt for your assignments.</p>
<p>Computing, i.e., programming and its foundational topics such as mathematics, is something that is best learned by example. But copying other people’s work alone is not sufficient. We must internalize that work, i.e., we must understand how someone else’s code works, how it does it, and why. Without that internalization, we simply copy someone else’s work. And that is not sufficient to pass a course.</p>

<section id="be-cool-like-a-pro">
<h1>Be cool, like a <em>pro</em><a class="headerlink" href="#be-cool-like-a-pro" title="Link to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>In additional to the technical content of the course, there is a professional element to it. The professional element of the course is meant to cultivate your <strong>essential work skills</strong> (some call them “soft skills”). These skills are highly sought after by employers. Essential skills include communication skills, neatness, punctuality, dependability, ability to work in teams, problem solving skills, etc.</p>
<p>In the context of this course, professionalism and essential skills are as follows.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Be clear in your communications. When sending an email, make sure that it has an opening, an objective, and a closing.</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>The opening is a greeting line. “Hey” is never an appropriate opening in professional communications.</p></li>
<li><p>The objective is the main part of your email. Be precise and concise. For example, instead of writing “may I ask a question”, just ask the question.</p></li>
<li><p>The closing is a statement as to what you would like the other party to do in response to your message.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Be respectful of others’ time. Here’re two examples:</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Come to meetings (class, student (aka office) hours, study groups, tutoring, etc) <strong>prepared.</strong> If the meeting is about reviewing your code, make sure that your laptop is sufficiently charged, the computer is turned on, and the code is already loaded into some editor before you even step into the meeting room. Do not spend 5 minutes in the meeting finding a power outlet, turning on and booting the computer, and firing up an editor.</p></li>
<li><p>Online class meetings are <strong>not</strong> the place to text the instructor questions related to individual concerns (your grade in a homework assignment etc.) Please do not use class time for such questions.</p></li>
<li><p>When in group meeting (e.g., class, study group, etc) keep your questions relevant to the objective of the meeting.</p></li>
<li><p>When making an appointment and you realize that you cannot attend the meeting, notify the other party as soon as possible.</p></li>
<li><p>When discussing a problem, be prepared to offer suggestions for reasonable solutions.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Be respectful of <strong>your own time.</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Try emailing a question instead of waiting for Student (office) Hours. If the question is related to programming, attach a copy of your code. In most cases you will get an answer within a few hours.</p></li>
<li><p>Read and understand instructions and requirements. They set the expectations for your work. It’s important that you follow them.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Be organized and neat.</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>When turning in homework or other assignments, make sure that your writing is legible and the overall appearance reflects quality and care. Content is always the most critical aspect of your work; but appearance counts too.</p></li>
<li><p>When submitting code, make sure the files are properly named. For example <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">homework.java</span></code> may make sense on your side of the shop, but from the grader’s perspective it’s not very helpful. Files should be named after the class they contain, and must include comments in the code identifying you as the author.</p></li>
<li><p>When submitting photos of your work, name the files accordingly. Instead of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">IMG_123.JPG</span></code> it should be called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">JohnDoe_problem1a.jpg</span></code> or something equally indicative of where the file is coming from and what it contains.</p></li>
<li><p>Follow instructions. Instructions and directions reflect expectations and requirements for your work. File naming conventions, deadlines, content style, etc, are important aspects of your work both in college and beyond.</p></li>
<li><p>Check your official Loyola email regularly (at least once a day, and definitely an hour before class).</p></li>
</ul>

<li><p>Every effort is made in this course to use open source, freely available material. However materials from the course cannot be shared outside the course without the instructor’s <em>written permission.</em></p></li>
<li><p>Loyola University provides <strong>reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities.</strong> Any student requesting accommodations related to a disability or other condition is required to register with Student Accessibility Center (SAC), located in Sullivan Center, Suite 117. Professors receive the accommodation notification from SAC via Accommodate. Students are encouraged to meet with their professor individually in order to discuss their accommodations. All information will remain confidential.  Please note that in this class, software may be used to record class lectures in order to provide equal access to students with disabilities.  Students approved for this accommodation use recordings for their personal study only and recordings may not be shared with other people or used in any way against the faculty member, other lecturers, or students whose classroom comments are recorded as part of the class activity.  Recordings are deleted at the end of the semester.  For more information about registering with SAC or questions about accommodations, please contact SAC at 773-508-3700 or <a class="reference external" href="mailto:SAC&#37;&#52;&#48;luc&#46;edu">SAC<span>&#64;</span>luc<span>&#46;</span>edu</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Accommodation letters.</strong> Students with accommodation letters from the university’s SAC need to alert me as early as possible in the course. In some of my courses, I conduct weekly in-class assessment instead of homework assignments. Students work on these assessments, during class, for 15-25 minutes. If your accommodation letter entitles you to extended time for testing, I will be happy to make arrangements so that you can return the in-class assessment to me within 24 hours. Please notify me as soon as possible, if you would like extended time fo in-class assessments.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Duty to report.</strong> Faculty and staff of the University have a mandated responsibility to report any incidents of gender-based misconduct that they are made aware of, even if it happened in the past. Gender-based misconduct includes discrimination based on actual or perceived sex, sexual orientation, gender expression or identity, or pregnancy or parenting status; dating and domestic violence; sexual misconduct (including sexual assault, sexual harassment, and sexual exploitation); and stalking.</p></li>
<li><p>Statement about <strong>online recording.</strong> In this class, software will be used to record live class discussions. As a student in this class, your participation in live class discussions will be recorded. These recordings will be made available only to students enrolled in the class, to assist those who cannot attend the live session or to serve as a resource for those who would like to review content that was presented. All recordings will become unavailable to students in the class when the Sakai course is unpublished (i.e. shortly after the course ends, per the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.luc.edu/its/itrs/sakai/administrativeschedule/">Sakai administrative schedule</a>). Students who prefer to participate via audio only will be allowed to disable their video camera so only audio will be captured. Please discuss this option with your instructor.The use of all video recordings will be in keeping with the University Privacy Statement shown below.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Privacy Statement.</strong> Assuring privacy among faculty and students engaged in online and face-to-face instructional activities helps promote open and robust conversations and mitigates concerns that comments made within the context of the class will be shared beyond the classroom. As such, recordings of instructional activities occurring in online or face-to-face classes may be used solely for internal class purposes by the faculty member and students registered for the course, and only during the period in which the course is offered. Students will be informed of such recordings by a statement in the syllabus for the course in which they will be recorded. Instructors who wish to make subsequent use of recordings that include student activity may do so only with informed written consent of the students involved or if all student activity is removed from the recording. Recordings including student activity that have been initiated by the instructor may be retained by the instructor only for individual use.</p></li>

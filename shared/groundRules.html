<h2>Be proactive<a class="headerlink" href="#be-proactive" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>In my experience, the single most common cause of poor performance in any course is when students are not proactive. When you are proactive you can recognize and address any issues with your courses, while you have time to do something about it. Learning to be proactive is one of the most valuable skills you can acquire in college.</p>
<p>Here’s how you can be proactive, so you can succeed in this coure.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Review homework (or other take-home tests) within 24 hours of assignment. Identify questions that may be challenging. Contact the instructor or seek tutoring to work on these questions. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.luc.edu/cs/academics/tutoring/">The Department of Computer Science offers tutoring services almost on a daily basis.</a></p></li>
<li><p>Significantly incomplete assignments and skipped assigments arena warning sign. Compare your solution to the published solution. Try to identify the differences. Speak with the instructor or a tutor if the differences are not clear.</p></li>
<li><p>Come to class and take notes. Form or join a study group comprising fellow students.</p></li>
<li><p>If, for any reason, you need to be absent from class, let me know in advance. I don’t need to know the reason, but I need to know about the duration of your absense.</p></li>
<li><p>Check your official Loyola email at least daily and absolutely an hour before class meetings.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="instructor-s-expectations">
<h1>Instructor’s expectations<a class="headerlink" href="#instructor-s-expectations" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h1>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Read your <strong>email</strong> regularly (like, twice a day).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Read</strong> everything carefully! Assignments, announcements, class notes, and program contents contain 99% of the information you need.</p></li>
<li><p>Make an <strong>effort.</strong> If you cannot finish the code, show some pseudocode.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ask for help.</strong> Spend between 20 and 40 minutes on an assignment. If you feel you are not making progress, ask for help.</p></li>
<li><p>The internet is full of sites with “solutions” to problems. Be careful when using them. Most of the stuff posted there is <strong>junk.</strong> If you use code from these sites, you must <strong>demonstrate</strong> that you understand it fully.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the Programmer’s Pact as a checklist before you submit code for evaluation. (COMP 170, 271 only).</p></li>
<li><p>No communications starting with the greeting <strong>“hey”.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>For code troubleshooting <strong>attach the program file</strong> to an email or message. Please, no screenshots or links to cloud storage services. (If you are using a hosted IDE like Collaboratory or repl.it, send me a link to the code but make sure the file is shared).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Be on time.</strong> Commuting around Chicago is always full of surprises. Delays may be inevitable. Nevertheless, punctuality is a formidable professional skill. Learn it, practice it!</p></li>
<li><p>If you make an <strong>appointment</strong> for Student Hours but cannot keep it, notify me as soon as possible.</p></li>
<li><p>When on Zoom, your <strong>camera must be on.</strong> (If your computer has no camera, if camera is broken etc, please let me know).</p></li>
<li><p>If I ask you a question in a message, please <strong>answer it.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Waiting for the <strong>last day</strong> to work on an assignment is risky. Ideally, you want to look at an assignment within the first 24 hours it is posted. Formulate a strategy. See if you have any questions to ask. Put some pseudocode to share with me.</p></li>
<li><p>Instead of asking if some idea could work, <strong>try it!</strong> The best way to tell if something works is to code it and find out for yourself. If it doesn’t work, you have a conversation starter when you reach out to me for assistance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Come to class.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>If you are taking an <strong>asynchronous</strong> course with me, please schedule at least 4 meetings with me during the term. These meetings must be spaced out throughout the semester. Plan your first meeting with me during week 3. It is a good idea to plan one meeting for the week after the midterm, to discuss progress. I also expect you to be in touch with me on a weekly basis, via email or messaging, with questions about your assignments, study, etc.</p></li>

<section id="grading-scheme">
<h1>Grading scheme<a class="headerlink" href="#grading-scheme" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>Course performance is determined using weekly assignments, a take-home midterm, and a take-home final. Each assessment component carries a 33.3% weight. Grading scheme aside, the objective of assessments in this course is to ensure <strong>that students are learning.</strong> In this context students make mistakes, understand them, and do not repeat them. To focus on improved performance, there will no grades given to assignments and exams. You will receive feedback about what you did well and what you need to work on. Your adherence to this feedback, as demonstrated in subsequent assignments, will determine your course grade. This style of assessment is called <em>ungrading</em> or <em>consultative assessment.</em></p>
<p>At midterm and at the end of the course, in addition to technical problems, you will be asked to write a brief reflection paper. In it you will assess how well you adhered to the feedback you received in the assignments, and you will propose your course grade. While I have the final say over your course grade, over the years I found that most students propose the correct grade for themselves. More often I give a higher grade than proposed; occasionally, a lower.</p>
</section>
<section id="ungrading-and-how-it-works">
<h1><em>Ungrading</em> and how it works<a class="headerlink" href="#ungrading-and-how-it-works" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h1>
<p><em>Ungrading</em> is a low-stress approach to evaluating progress through a course.</p>
<p>Most of us are used to traditional grading: we turn in an assignment, and we get it back with a numeric score or a letter grade. There may or may not be enough feedback for us to understand what we did wrong. And, worst, we are penalized for making mistakes when, in fact, mistakes are one of the hallmarks of learning.</p>
<p><em>Ungrading</em> focuses on constructive feedback. Each assignment is a learning opportunity: some things are done well, others could have been done better. The feedback you receive tells you what you have done well or what you need to work on in future assignments. You show progress by adjusting your work to incorporate the feedback you receive. The progress you demonstrate reflects your performance in the course. And it helps you suggest a course grade that you believe you deserve.</p>
<p>The course grade is the responsibility of the instructor. But you are expected to propose your grade. At midterm and near the end of the term, you will write a brief reflection statement. You will take into consideration the feedback you received. And how much of it you incorporated in your work. Based on <em>your assessment</em> you will propose a letter grade: A, B, C, or D. The instructor will take that statement into consideration in determining your course grade.</p>
<p>A good way to demonstrate that you incorporate feedback into your work is to avoid the same issues. These can be technical or soft issues. Technical issues are easy to identify: for example if you are writing methods with multiple returns, you may be asked to reduce them to just one return statement. If you continue to write methods with multiple returns, you are not incorporating the feedback very productively. If you have a reason to ignore the feedback, you should discuss it with the instructor.</p>
<p>In general, technical issues are based on requirements, specifications, and the Programmer’s Pact. Soft issues may be more challenging: skipping assignment, turning assignments late, not attending class meetings, not reaching out for assistance, etc.</p>

<section id="midterm-reflection">
<h3>Midterm reflection<a class="headerlink" href="#midterm-reflection" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What aspects of the course have been the most successful for you so far?</p></li>
<li><p>What thing that you’ve learned are you most excited about?</p></li>
<li><p>What challenges have you encountered?</p></li>
<li><p>Can you suggest one or two areas that it may be worth focusing/improving?</p></li>
<li><p>Based on your performance so far, what do you feel your course grade should be? Choose from A, B, C, or D.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="end-of-term-reflection">
<h3>End-of-term reflection<a class="headerlink" href="#end-of-term-reflection" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Write me a short letter that reflects on your work in this class.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider the work you did on exams, assignments, and lab/studio sessions, the feedback you gave and received, and how you met your own goals.</p></li>
<li><p>Feel free to include examples of your work as necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>Did you miss any significant work?</p></li>
<li><p>Is there anything you are particularly proud of?</p></li>
<li><p>If, in the midterm reflection, you identified any areas for improvement/focus, how did you do?</p></li>
<li><p>What letter grade would you give yourself in this course? Choose from A, B, C, or D. (Ideally, I would give everyone the grade they give themselves, but I reserve the right to raise or lower grades as appropriate.)</p></li>

<section id="frequently-asked-questions-about-ungrading">
<h2>Frequently Asked Questions about <em>Ungrading</em><a class="headerlink" href="#frequently-asked-questions-about-ungrading" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p><strong>What is the grade I see in Sakai?</strong> Everytime you submit an assignment, you will earn 1 point. This is not the score of the assignment. This is just Sakai’s way of keeping track who submitted an assignment. Whether your assignment is spot on or off the mark, you will earn 1 point for submitting it. These points do not translate to a score that determines a course grade.</p>
<p><strong>Is there a grade scale?</strong> Yes. Students who do not get the same feedback throughout their assignments, usually finish with an A or an A-. Students that require 2-3 reminders for certain things may end the course with a grade in the B range. Students that require more frequent feedback for various technical issues but do finally move on, will end the course with a grade in the C range. Students that do not incorporate the feedback will probably finish the course with a D. Rarely, a student may finish the course with an F. I try to avoid this grade; if I feel that you are heading towards an F, I’ll reach out to you to discuss improvement or alternative plans.</p>
<p><strong>Will there be make-up assignments?</strong> Every assignment is a make-up assignment: an opportunity to improve on issues that were identified in previous assignments. There will be no extra assignments, however.</p>
<p><strong>Why are doing this?</strong>  <em>Ungrading</em> is very similar to a job situation. We receive feedback from peers and supervisors. The feedback tells us what we do well and what needs more attention. We use the feedback to meet new challenges, improve our skills, and advance our careers. <em>Ungrading</em> is also less stressful because you do not have to worry about a grade scale. It allows you to focus on learning and it is forgiving with mistakes that are not repeated.)</p>

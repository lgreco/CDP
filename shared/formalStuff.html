<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://www.luc.edu/academics/schedules">university’s official Academic Calendar</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Every effort is made in this course to use open source, freely available material. However materials from the course cannot be shared outside the course without the instructor’s <em>written permission.</em></p></li>
<li><p>Loyola University provides <strong>reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities.</strong> Any student requesting accommodations related to a disability or other condition is required to register with Student Accessibility Center (SAC), located in Sullivan Center, Suite 117. Professors receive the accommodation notification from SAC via Accommodate. Students are encouraged to meet with their professor individually in order to discuss their accommodations. All information will remain confidential.  Please note that in this class, software may be used to record class lectures in order to provide equal access to students with disabilities.  Students approved for this accommodation use recordings for their personal study only and recordings may not be shared with other people or used in any way against the faculty member, other lecturers, or students whose classroom comments are recorded as part of the class activity.  Recordings are deleted at the end of the semester.  For more information about registering with SAC or questions about accommodations, please contact SAC at 773-508-3700 or <a class="reference external" href="mailto:SAC&#37;&#52;&#48;luc&#46;edu">SAC<span>&#64;</span>luc<span>&#46;</span>edu</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Accommodation letters.</strong> Students with accommodation letters from the university’s SAC need to alert me as early as possible in the course. In some of my courses, I conduct weekly in-class assessment instead of homework assignments. Students work on these assessments, during class, for 15-25 minutes. If your accommodation letter entitles you to extended time for testing, I will be happy to make arrangements so that you can return the in-class assessment to me within 24 hours. Please notify me as soon as possible, if you would like extended time fo in-class assessments.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Duty to report.</strong> Faculty and staff of the University have a mandated responsibility to report any incidents of gender-based misconduct that they are made aware of, even if it happened in the past. Gender-based misconduct includes discrimination based on actual or perceived sex, sexual orientation, gender expression or identity, or pregnancy or parenting status; dating and domestic violence; sexual misconduct (including sexual assault, sexual harassment, and sexual exploitation); and stalking.</p></li>
<li><p>Statement about <strong>online recording.</strong> If the course uses software to record class discussions: as a student in this class, your participation in live class discussions will be recorded. These recordings will be made available only to students enrolled in the class, to assist those who cannot attend the live session or to serve as a resource for those who would like to review content that was presented. All recordings will become unavailable to students in the class when the Sakai course is unpublished (i.e. shortly after the course ends, per the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.luc.edu/its/itrs/sakai/administrativeschedule/">Sakai administrative schedule</a>). The use of all video recordings will be in keeping with the University Privacy Statement shown below.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Privacy Statement.</strong> Assuring privacy among faculty and students engaged in online and face-to-face instructional activities helps promote open and robust conversations and mitigates concerns that comments made within the context of the class will be shared beyond the classroom. As such, recordings of instructional activities occurring in online or face-to-face classes may be used solely for internal class purposes by the faculty member and students registered for the course, and only during the period in which the course is offered. Students will be informed of such recordings by a statement in the syllabus for the course in which they will be recorded. Instructors who wish to make subsequent use of recordings that include student activity may do so only with informed written consent of the students involved or if all student activity is removed from the recording. Recordings including student activity that have been initiated by the instructor may be retained by the instructor only for individual use.</p></li>

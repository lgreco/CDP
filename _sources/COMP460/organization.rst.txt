This graduate course reprises topics from the typical undergraduate course in algorithms, placing more emphasis on analysis, proofs, and advanced designs and implementations. The course also looks at more advanced topics, like graph isomorphism, reductions for NP-hard problems, cryptography algorithms, etc.

The actual outline for the course varies depending on the interest and backgrounds of participating students. Usually we begin with a review of topics that you may have encountered in advanced undergraduate courses in data structures and algorithms.

* Asymptotic notation, space and time complexity: why it matters?
* The source of all evil and good: recursion and its master theorem.
* Dynamic programming (i.e., recursion done right).
* Trees and how to traverse, rotate, and rebalance them. And why bother?
* Graph algorithms (destroy your enemies' train network!)
* String algorithms

From there we begin to explore a few more advanced topics: the commonalities of some algorithms for graphs, topological sorting, graph isomorphism, and verifiability.

Next we explore some challenging problems that are very difficult to solve (NP-hard problems) and how we can compromise our approach to reach acceptable, but not perfect, solutions. Usually we look at the satisfiability problem, weight independent sets, etc.

Finally, if we have time, we'll venture into algorithmic information theory.

As we begin to wrap up the course we'll spend some time reviewing topics and questions that may come up during a job interview.



The goal of this course is to reinforce existing skills in algorithms before advancing them through the exploration of more demanding topics.  Actual programming will be interspersed with theoretical analysis, to demonstrate practical issues in the implementation of algorithmic solutions. We will use a programming language (Python) to practice design and implementation of algorithms. 

You must have access to a computer capable of accessing the web. 


Course Objectives
+++++++++++++++++

- Expand the skills to analyze **and verify** algorithms.

- Implement advanced algorithms

- Understand heuristics.

- Explore algorithmic information theory.


Textbook
+++++++++++++++++


There is no required textbook for COMP 460. A good book to have is *Algorithms,* by Jeff Erickson. `The book is available online at no cost <https://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/>`__. Printed copies can be purchased from online retailers at reasonable cost. Other useful (but not required) books for this course include:

* `Algorithms Illuminated <http://www.algorithmsilluminated.org/>`_;
* the `standard text in the field <http://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262046305/introduction-to-algorithms/>`_, and; 
naturally the `Art of Computer Programming <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Computer_Programming>`_.

Deadlines
+++++++++++++++++

No late homework will be accepted. If you anticipate an issue with late submission, it is your responsibility to contact the instructor as soon as possible. *Bona fide* emergencies will be handled on a case-by-case basis.



Exam dates
+++++++++++++++++


The final and midterm exams will be a take-home assignments. Exact dates will be posted on Sakai.

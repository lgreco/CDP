* *The Pattern on the Stone: The Simple Ideas that Make Computers Work,* by W Daniel Hillis. This is a computer architecture book written in simpler terms than a typical college textbook. It explains how computers are designed and built in simple terms using metaphons and analogies. The author is a pioneer in the field of computing. In the 1980s, Hillis founded the *Thinking Machine Corporation* and produced some of the most formidable massively-parallel computers of its era.

In the course we'll use C to write programs that take us closer to the hardware than other, more modern, languages. The best way to learn C is to read `Kernighan and Ritchie <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language>`_, cover to cover and practice everything in it. If you do not want to commit to this book, you may want to use some of the resources available to you at no cost from the O'Reilly library. 

I have assembled a few textbooks that can help you learn C. `Any of the first three books in this collection can help you along the course <https://learning.oreilly.com/playlists/06ec0d45-aeb9-49c2-acb7-1077a7117d48/>`_. You will need to login with your LUC email address to access the material in this collection. The last two books in this collection are a bit more advanced. They are very useful if you'd like to learn a bit more C.

COMP 180 serves two purposes: one is to introduce you to simple programming, using *Python*. The other is to show you how you can process and manage data (using Python, of course). Data processing and data management require some mathema**g**ical skills. Any college-level course in algebra or calculus is sufficient background.

Grading scheme
++++++++++++++

Course performance is determined using weekly homework, a take-home midterm, and a take-home final. Each assessment component carries a 33.33% weight. Grading scheme aside, the objective of assessments in this course is to ensure **that students are learning.** In this context students make mistakes, understand them, and do not repeat them.

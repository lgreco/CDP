Variables
==========

Variables are nicknames for data. Data can be numbers, sequences of symbols (letters *are* symbols), images, etc. For example can have a variable for the year a person was born

.. code-block:: python

   birth_year = 2000

A variable has two parts, two components: its name and its content. In the example above, ``birth_year`` is the name of the variable. The content, in the example above, is ``2000``. 

Variable names can be descriptive, as in the example above, or obscure like ``y=2000``. There was a time when programmers had to work with really annoying limits regarding the names of variables. This is no longer the case: we can name a variable just about anything we want to. There are still a few restrictions, but as long as a variable name doesn't begin with a number or a silly symbol like an exclamation point, the sky is the limit. For example, ``yob``, ``year_of_birth``, ``birthYear``, ``yearThis_person_was_Born``, are all valid names. 

Naming variables is one of the hardest thing in computing. Thankfully, there are style guides for each language, including `Python <https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#316-naming>`__.

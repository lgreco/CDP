The central goal of this course is to impart basic skills in designing and implementing efficient and effective computer programs. The course begins by developing models and mathematical tools for measuring the efficiency of algorithms, followed by a variety of useful data structures and to algorithms for a variety of fundamental problems. Finally, the course will provide an introduction to classification of computational problems into different complexity classes. Actual programming will be interspersed with theoretical analysis, to demonstrate practical issues in the implementation of algorithmic solutions.

Designing *good* algorithms is central to software design. So, what makes an algorithm good? This goes beyond just arriving at the right answer, to arriving at this right answer efficiently. After all, you don't want to be staring at your computer all day just to get the sum of a dozen numbers. Efficiency is not just with respect to time, but also the resources required to solve the problem. Central to our discussion of algorithms will be the evaluation of solutions. Algorithms at its heart is problem solving. 

In this course we will focus on tapping into our creativity to identify possible solutions to a given problem. The course will blend application and theory. We will use a programming language (to be determined) to practice design and implementation of algorithms. 

You must have access to a computer (Mac, Windows, or
Ubuntu operating system) that s/he has administrative rights, i.e. can install software. Computers must
have a minimum of 4 GB of RAM and a reliable internet connection.

Textbook
++++++++

The required textbook for COMP 363 is *Algorithms,* by Jeff Erickson. `The book is available online at no cost <https://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/>`__. Printed copies can be purchased from online retailers for about $30.

Grading scheme
++++++++++++++

Course performance is determined using weekly assignments, a take-home midterm, and a take-home final. Each assessment component carries a 33.3% weight. Grading scheme aside, the objective of assessments in this course is to ensure **that students are learning.** In this context students make mistakes, understand them, and do not repeat them.

Grading scale
+++++++++++++

In general, if your total score in the class is > 90% you should expect an A. For a B, your score should be between 80% and 90%. If your score is between 65% and 70%, you should expect a C. These ranges may change during the course. I do not provide a breakdown for **plus** and **minus** grade points.

Deadlines
+++++++++

No late homework will be accepted. If you anticipate an issue with late submission, it is your responsibility to contact the instructor as soon as possible. *Bona fide* emergencies will be handled on a case-by-case basis.

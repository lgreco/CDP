Outline
-------

This is the tentative outline for the course.

- Unit 1: tools and techniques. Python, the *Markdown* markup language, LaTex (another markup language), discrete mathematics. Upper bound notation (big-oh :math:`\mathcal{O}()` notation). Example of a simple algorithm: Newton's method to find :math:`\sqrt{x}`.  

- Unit 2: String alignment. Problems with optimal substructure. From brute force with nearly infinite scenarios to practical solutions that can be delivered in polynomial time.

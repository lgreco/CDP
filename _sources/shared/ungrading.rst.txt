Grading scheme
--------------------------------------------------------

Course performance is determined using weekly assignments, a take-home midterm, and a take-home final. Each assessment component carries a 33.3% weight. Grading scheme aside, the objective of assessments in this course is to ensure **that students are learning.** In this context students make mistakes, understand them, and do not repeat them. To focus on improved performance, there will no grades given to assignments and exams. You will receive feedback about what you did well and what you need to work on. Your adherence to this feedback, as demonstrated in subsequent assignments, will determine your course grade. This style of assessment is called *ungrading* or *consultative assessment.*


At midterm and at the end of the course, in addition to technical problems, you will be asked to write a brief reflection paper. In it you will assess how well you adhered to the feedback you received in the assignments, and you will propose your course grade. While I have the final say over your course grade, over the years I found that most students propose the correct grade for themselves. More often I give a higher grade than proposed; occasionally, a lower. 


*Ungrading* and how it works
--------------------------------------------------------

*Ungrading* is a low-stress approach to evaluating progress through a course. 

Most of us are used to traditional grading: we turn in an assignment, and we get it back with a numeric score or a letter grade. There may or may not be enough feedback for us to understand what we did wrong. And, worst, we are penalized for making mistakes when, in fact, mistakes are one of the hallmarks of learning. 

*Ungrading* focuses on constructive feedback. Each assignment is a learning opportunity: some things are done well, others could have been done better. The feedback you receive tells you what you have done well or what you need to work on in future assignments. You show progress by adjusting your work to incorporate the feedback you receive. The progress you demonstrate reflects your performance in the course. And it helps you suggest a course grade that you believe you deserve.

The course grade is the responsibility of the instructor. But you are expected to propose your grade. At midterm and near the end of the term, you will write a brief reflection statement. You will take into consideration the feedback you received. And how much of it you incorporated in your work. Based on *your assessment* you will propose a letter grade: A, B, C, or D. The instructor will take that statement into consideration in determining your course grade.

A good way to demonstrate that you incorporate feedback into your work is to avoid the same issues. These can be technical or soft issues. Technical issues are easy to identify: for example if you are writing methods with multiple returns, you may be asked to reduce them to just one return statement. If you continue to write methods with multiple returns, you are not incorporating the feedback very productively. If you have a reason to ignore the feedback, you should discuss it with the instructor. 

In general, technical issues are based on requirements, specifications, and the Programmer's Pact. Soft issues may be more challenging: skipping assignment, turning assignments late, not attending class meetings, not reaching out for assistance, etc. 

One thing I learned as a teacher, is that most students know how well they do in a course. *Ungrading* helps me work with students to articulate that sense of learning, affirm the skills they develop, and focus on skills that may need a bit more effort. 

Reflection statements
+++++++++++++++++++++


For the midterm and end-of-term reflections statements, I use `Jesse Stommel's suggestions <https://www.jessestommel.com/ungrading-an-faq/>`__ with some additional questions.

Midterm reflection
==================

* What aspects of the course have been the most successful for you so far? 
* What thing that you've learned are you most excited about?
* What challenges have you encountered? 
* Can you suggest one or two areas that it may be worth focusing/improving?
* Based on your performance so far, what do you feel your course grade should be? Choose from A, B, C, or D.

End-of-term reflection
======================
* Write me a short letter that reflects on your work in this class. 
* Consider the work you did on exams, assignments, and lab/studio sessions, the feedback you gave and received, and how you met your own goals. 
* Feel free to include examples of your work as necessary. 
* Did you miss any significant work? 
* Is there anything you are particularly proud of?
* If, in the midterm reflection, you identified any areas for improvement/focus, how did you do?
* What letter grade would you give yourself in this course? Choose from A, B, C, or D. (Ideally, I would give everyone the grade they give themselves, but I reserve the right to raise or lower grades as appropriate.)

Frequently Asked Questions about *Ungrading*
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


**What is the grade I see in Sakai?** Everytime you submit an assignment, you will earn 1 point. This is not the score of the assignment. This is just Sakai's way of keeping track who submitted an assignment. Whether your assignment is spot on or off the mark, you will earn 1 point for submitting it. These points do not translate to a score that determines a course grade.

**Is there a grade scale?** Yes. Students that do not get the same feedback throughout their assignments, usually finish with an A or an A-. Students that require 2-3 reminders for certain things may end the course with a grade in the B range. Students that require more frequent feedback for various technical issues but do finally move on, will end the course with a grade in the C range. Students that do not incorporate the feedback will probably finish the course with a D. Rarely, a student may finish the course with an F. I try to avoid this grade; if I feel that you are heading towards an F, I'll reach out to you to discuss improvement or alternative plans.

**Will there be make-up assignments?** Every assignment is a make-up assignment: an opportunity to improve on issues that were identified in previous assignments. There will be no extra assignments, however.

**Why?**  *Ungrading* is very similar to a job situation. We receive feedback from peers and supervisors. The feedback tells us what we do well and what needs more attention. We use the feedback to meet new challenges, improve our skills, and advance our careers. *Ungrading* is also less stressful because you do not have to worry about a grade scale. It allows you to focus on learning and it is forgiving with mistakes that are not repeated.)

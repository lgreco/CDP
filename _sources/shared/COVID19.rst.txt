Course operations in response to the COVID-19 measures
------------------------------------------------------

As of 3/13/20, Loyola University Chicago has suspended most of face-to-face class meetings. The university is preparing to open for the fall term of 2021. In summer of 2021, **COMP 271** is offered as a *HyFlex* course: you may attend in person or remotely via Zoom.

* The principal method for online meetings is Zoom. You must `have it installed on your computer, tablet, or smartphone <https://zoom.us/download>`_. A link to our Zoom "classroom" is available on the course's Sakai site, on the left side navigation menu. There will be no separate emails with the Zoom link. 


* If, at any time, Zoom is unavailable due to high-demand or any other reason, our fall-back method for online meetings will be Google Hangouts. You will need to `sign up for a free Google account <https://accounts.google.com/signup/>`_, if you do not already have one. (If you have a gmail address, you have a Google account). In case we need to switch to Google Hangouts for a class meeting, you will be notified by email. 


* If we experience a Zoom disruption during the first half of class meeting, we will switch to Google Hangouts immediately. If the disruption occurs during the second half of the class meeting, we'll cancel the rest of the meeting, and I will provide notes and reading suggestions to make up for the lost time.


* If Zoom and Google Hangouts are not available, I will switch to Reflector 051C on the DSTAR system for `amateur radio <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio>`__. This Reflector is carried by the NS9RC repeater in the Chicagoland area. My call sign is KC9GLI. And if DSTAR is affected, I will broadcast on 14.25 MHz and 7.22 MHz, Upper Side Band, on the amateur frequencies, same callsign.

* Seriously now, if there is a disruption to a Zoom meeting, please check your Loyola email within 5 minutes. As soon as I troubleshoot the disruption and determine the best course of action, I will email you with instructions about how and where to reconvene.

* Zoom sessions are recorded and available to watch later if, for some reason you may not be able to attend a class meeting. Notice that the availability of recordings is not a reason to skip class. Zoom provides me with attendance information and I will be monitoring it closely. Remember that some courses include in-class assessments as part of the grading scheme. I am planning to continue conducting these assessments, so your attendance is critical. Links to recordings are provided at the end of this section.

* **Student hours** (aka, office hours) are **by appointment only**. `Please use the Calendly website to schedule an appointment <https://calendly.com/leo_irakliotis/20min>`__. 

* During these challenging times, I am committed to making online classes as engaging and productive as possible. To achieve that, I will need your help. Please reach out to me at any time with suggestions, concerns, and ideas related to the course and to your studies. If you prefer to share your thoughts in a confidential way, you can `use an anonymous feedback form <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfbbQkdO0buLZp17udHjphZYgZwkcZBgp3Tx6k0f6iMV_TykQ/viewform?usp=sf_link>`_. Communications are key at a time like this!




Recordings
----------

Notice that at times of high network traffic or high demand, these recordings may be temporarily unavailable. The university is attempting to address this issue. Recordings are made available only to Loyola Students. Authentication (using your LUC login credentials) is required. These recordings will be removed after the semester is over. Downloading of these recordings is not possible.

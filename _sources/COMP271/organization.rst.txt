This course explores the concepts of data abstraction and data structure, including stacks, queues, lists, sets, and trees. The issues of implementing a data structure in a language such as Java are examined using classes, arrays, and linked structures. Sorting and searching techniques are analyzed. The concepts of correctness and efficiency of algorithms are developed. Time/space comparisons of iterative algorithms with recursive algorithms are made. 

The tentative outline for the course is as follows.

 - Introduction to Java
 - Object-Oriented Concepts
 - Additional Features of Programming and Java
 - Analysis of Algorithms
 - Java Collections Framework
 - Recursion
 - Array-Based Lists
 -  Linked Lists
 - Stacks and Queues
 - Binary Trees
 - Binary Search Trees
 - Sorting
 - Tree Maps and Tree Sets
 - Priority Queues
 - Hashing
 - Graphs, Trees, and Networks
 
Time permitting the course will cover unusual data strutures like blockchain and relational models.


Textbook
++++++++

*Building Java Programs: A Back to Basics Approach,* 5th Edition, by Stuart Reges and Marty Stepp. (Yes, this is the textbook used in COMP 170)

Computer Equipment
++++++++++++++++++
You will need access to a desktop or laptop computer with a simple text editor and a Java compiler. An Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) is a superb tool and   and `IntelliJ IDEA <https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/>`_, is the IDE of choice for this course. You may also request a virtual machine that comes with all the necessary tools and that you may access from any web browser, anywhere in the world.

Grading scheme
++++++++++++++

Course performance is determined using weekly assignments, a take-home midterm, and a take-home final. Each assessment component carries a 33.3% weight. Grading scheme aside, the objective of assessments in this course is to ensure **that students are learning.** In this context students make mistakes, understand them, and do not repeat them. To focus on improved performance, there will no grades given to assignments and exams. You will receive feedback about what you did well and what you need to work on. Your adherence to this feedback, as demonstrated in subsequent assignments, will determine your course grade. This style of assessment is called *ungrading* or *consultative grading.*


Grading scale
+++++++++++++

At midterm and at the end of the course, in addition to technical problems, you will be asked to write a brief reflection paper. In it you will assess how well you adhered to the feedback you received in the assignments, and you will propose your course grade. While I have the final say over your course grade, over the years I found that most students propose the correct grade for themselves. More often I give a higher grade than proposed; occasionally, a lower.

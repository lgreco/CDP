Shameless self-promotion
========================

I am a Chicago-based educator, researcher, and college manager. In 1999, I earned a PhD in Electrical [and Computer] Engineering from Colorado State University. My work was in optical information processing (optical computing, the unsung sibling of quantum computing). I've worked as a professor, dean, and provost prior to my teaching position at Loyola University Chicago. My funding record to date stands at $17m in grants and contracts. I am an expert in database design, competency-based education, and online learning modalities. 

As a consultant, I have worked with small and medium-size enterprises on technology and strategy. And as an expert in credential evaluations, I have conducted over 200 Direct Assessments and Credit for Prior Learning evaluations.

In my free time, I am a photographer, diver, aviator, amateur radio operator, and the guardian of two dogs (Martin and Mina).
